# cs229-project
## By Mac Bagwell

This repo contains the source code that powers a scraper for MLB Advanced Media's Gameday servers,
the calculation of point-in-time elo ratings, and the generation of my figures and models
for my CS229 Project. 

It also contains a copy of my [final report](./final_report.pdf).
